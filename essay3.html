      <h1>For the Love of the Game</h1>
      <p>One of the best podcasts that I've listened to is called "Passion and Pain." I listened to it a year ago. Two weeks ago, a conversation with a friend reminded me of that podcast.</p>
      <p>Our conversation revolved around wealth and how bad he wanted it. Keep in mind, we're two broke college students at the time of writing this. We know nothing about wealth. But, the one thing that I understand in this world is that we are able to get a preview of certain paths in life by reading biographies and listening to podcasts. He has not read biographies nor does he consume podcasts voraciously. Neither have I to the standard that I hold myself.</p>
      <p>The one question that I repeated to him is how bad do you want it? Are you ready for the pain that you are about to endure? It's fine if you haven't. But have you at least done a scouting report? Looked ahead at a preview for those that have come before you?</p>
      <p>Like I said, it's fine if you haven't. Sheer ignorance towards something that you're passionate about does not stop you from starting. As a person that cares for you, I just feel an obligation to warn you. To warn you that if you are not passionate, then it tends to bring more pain. If you are passionate, the pain becomes numbing.</p>
      <p>The conversation faded towards other stuff, but that phrase has lingered for the past two weeks now. Passion and pain. The idealization of entrepreneurship has become so enthralled with my generation. Instead of recommending it, I'd scream and shout all the warning signs. Stay away. This game has to be something you need to do, not want.</p>
      <p>We only live one life. I'd sure as hell wouldn't want to waste it on something that I didn't respect or love.</p>
      <p>I don't consider myself a founder. What the fuck have I founded? I'm disrespecting the game and those that have come before me.</p>
      <p>Yet from what I've read from actual founders, it is a lifestyle. Little on this path do not find balance. Nor are they happy. Their marriages tend to fail. Children despise them. Friends don't consider them friends. Yet, founders are needed in this world. They are what drives innovation and creativity. And for some odd reason, there is an innate drive for me to be part of a founder's life. Whether that results in me being a founder or being an A+ player in a company that is riding an early wave, only time will tell.</p>
      <p>Respecting the game.</p>
      <p>If you are going to love the game, you must respect the game. Kobe admired Michael. MJ looked up to another MJ. Respect those that came before you. It is a rule, not a choice.</p>
      <p>So whenever I see people thinking about playing the game of entrepreneurship, even though I don't consider myself out of any caliber yet for it, I tend to hesitate to tell them to pursue it.</p>
      <p>If I have to tell you to do it, then don't do it. Then we'll see whether you do it or not.</p>
      <p>You respect the game.</p>
