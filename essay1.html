      <h1>When You Struggle I Struggle</h1>
      <p>One of the things I will always choose in life is struggle. Struggle over comfort any day. One thing I want to make sure my close friends know is that when you struggle.</p>

      <p>The world is full of struggle. Everyone around you is battling their own struggles. I don’t want to sound as some sort of righteous person. I believe that I’m one of the shittiest people in the world. Why? I don’t let my inner voice treat myself as if.</p>

      <p>In a world that is full of struggle and burden, where everyone is battling their inner struggles and burdens, those closest to me, I choose to struggle with them. That’s one of the burdens I put heavily on my life. Why? Because. Well, because life feels more alive. Knowing that we are going through the same thing. Knowing that someone is in your corner. Even if I can’t always be there. I’m trying to make a more conscious effort.</p>
