      <h1>A Culmination of My Favorite Songs</h1>
      <p>Just a culmination of my favorite songs, cause why not? Some with meaning. Some without. Some songs currently resonating with me. Some songs I liked because they used to resonate with me. Why? Why not though.</p>
      <p>Here's how I'll break up the categories.</p>

      <h2> Songs That Have Resonated for the Past Millennia</h2>

      <h3> Are You Bored Yet</h3>
      <p>This song to me is about my relationships in life. There are relationships where I know I’m growing apart from them. That’s a part of life. But we still see each other and understand that we’re growing apart. Are we both going to acknowledge that we won’t see each other as much? Are we bored of the day-to-day bullshit?</p>
      <blockquote>"When we get old will we regret this?"</blockquote>
      <p>Actually, this whole chorus is my favorite:</p>
      <blockquote>"Cause we could stay at home or watch the sunset<br>
      But I can’t help from askin', 'Are you bored yet?'<br>
      And if you’re feelin’ lonely, you should tell me<br>
      Before this ends up as another memory<br>
      Will you tell the truth so I don’t have to lie?"</blockquote>

      <h3>Treacherous Doctor</h3>
      <p>If you wanted to summarize all of my insecurities into a song, this would be it.</p>

      <h2>  Songs That My Heart Resonates With</h2>

      <h3>  I Am Not Who I Was</h3>
      <p>This song summarizes my battle with the fear of people not accepting me for changing. Will you still like me for who I was to you? Did you even like me because of who I was? Or was I just a tool?</p>

      <h3> Let It Go</h3>
      <p>We’re all imperfect. So why don’t you and I just let go of the baggage that’s holding us back from having fun and being happy?</p>
      <blockquote>You be you. Me be me.</blockquote>

      <h3> Moonlight</h3>
      <p>Dancing with you in the moonlight in an empty parking lot. Sounds like a great way to create a core memory.</p>

      <h3> Different Age</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, around people, I don’t belong. And it’s pretty obvious. I used to be insecure about it. Now, I’ve learned to use it to my advantage.</p>

      <h3 Open</h3>
      <p>Are we done with the bullshit? All the toxic emotions? Are you ready to jump into the ocean with our arms wide open?</p>

      <h3 Talk</h3>
      <p>Can I just be quiet for a moment? Like...what if we just don’t talk?</p>

      <h3 Slow It Down</h3>
      <p>I’m the reason in your head right now. So slow it down. Life will be fine.</p>

      <h2>  Songs That Express Emotions I Can’t Express</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>War</li>
        <li>Bleeding Out</li>
        <li>Feel It All</li>
        <li>Disco</li>
        <li>Don’t Wake Me Up</li>
        <li>Chuyện Đôi Ta</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>  Songs That I Just Vibe To (Sad or Happy)</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Mona Lisa</li>
        <li>Stop the World</li>
        <li>Feel It</li>
        <li>Lullabies</li>
      </ul>
