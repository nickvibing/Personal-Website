      <h1>To Just Exist</h1>
      <p>what is a saying that encapsulates the feelings of life? is it, "to just exist with someone". maybe it's "experience life with someone". I don't know. I'm just trying to find something that encapsulates the feelings of life that I am searching for. maybe it's, let the moment capture you. Or is it control the moment? savor the moment? these are my thoughts that are just rambling from thought to thought hoping to find something that resonates. Or it's "find people that you want to experience life with." who knows. </p>

      <p>life is this platter that is served to us and it is up to us to decide what we want the platter to be.</p>
