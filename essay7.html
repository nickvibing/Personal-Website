      <h1>Do I Take Life Seriously?</h1>
      <p>I don’t. At least, I don’t think so. Seriously. That’s my answer.</p>
      <p>I don’t feel like I take life too seriously. To other people, I might. I used to care about what other people thought. Now, I don’t.</p>
      <p>But let’s just play this thought experiment for a second.</p>
      <p>Do I take life so seriously?</p>
      <p>Yeah, maybe compared to some people. I don’t play video games anymore. I have a love-hate relationship with social media. I tend to think philosophically in some regards.</p>
      <p>Whenever people question me with, “Why do you take life so seriously?” I tend to replace the word "serious" with "fun."</p>
      <p>Because the normal fun at my age isn’t fun for me anymore.</p>
      <p>Fun is going out to a national park for a spontaneous trip with friends. Or going down the sand dunes. Or cooking burgers. Or going out and capturing raw moments of life. Or writing. That’s fun for me now.</p>
      <p>My fun is different from your fun. Do I question why you’re not taking life seriously? Of course. But maybe you are, in some regard. As long as you’re having fun, then why does my opinion matter?</p>
      <p>So. There it is. Live a little to your own standard. Laugh a lot.</p>
